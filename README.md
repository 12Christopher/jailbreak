What Is Jailbreaking?
Jailbreaking is the process of cracking into your iPhone to bypass the usual iOS restrictions. This lets you install software on your phone from developers that can't publish to the App Store. The main reason people choose to jailbreak is for more customization options.
To jailbreak your iPhone, you have to go through the process of installing Cydia on your device. If you're wondering if jailbreaking is right for you, we've previously looked at whether or not you should jailbreak.
It is worth noting that jailbreaking your iPhone can leave it open to security vulnerabilities in apps, software, and iOS itself. In some cases, if you have a problem with your iPhone, Apple may not fix it if your device is jailbroken.
Also, once you have jailbroken, you cannot update your iPhone without needing to re-jailbreak. You won't be able to do this if there is no jailbreak for the new version of iOS.
It's worth noting that a Mac is the easiest platform for completing the jailbreak process. If you have access to a Mac, we recommend using that computer. Whichever platform you use, though, you'll need some additional programs for the jailbreak. We'll show you how to download these and what to do with them in the relevant tutorial. Your iPhone can be running any version of iOS between 15 and 15.2 for this method. At some point, you'll need to download the latest version of unc0ver on your iPhone. The site has an FAQ section for any questions you might have.
